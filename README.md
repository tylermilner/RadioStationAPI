# RadioStationAPI
A Swift Vapor project for a generic internet radio station API.

Based on the RAML API spec located [here](https://github.com/tylermilner/RadioStationAPISpec).

**ðŸš§ This is a work in progress. ðŸš§**
* The general structure of the API has been defined, but is subject to change at any point.
* The endpoints have been stubbed out with static responses for now.
* A Postman collection is available in the `Postman` directory.
